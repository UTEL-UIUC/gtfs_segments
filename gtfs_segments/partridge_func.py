def get_bus_feed(path: str, agency_id: Any = None, threshold: int = 1) -> Tuple[str, Feed]:
    """
    The `get_bus_feed` function retrieves bus feed data from a specified path, with the option to filter
    by agency name, and returns the busiest date and a GTFS feed object.
    
    Args:
      path (str): The `path` parameter is a string that represents the path to the GTFS file. This file
    contains the bus feed data.
      agency_id (All): The `agency_id` parameter is an optional parameter that allows you to filter the
    bus feed data by the agency name. It is used to specify the ID of the transit agency for which you
    want to retrieve the bus feed data. If you provide an `agency_id`, the function will only return
    data
      threshold (int): The `threshold` parameter is used to filter out service IDs that have a low
    frequency. It is set to a default value of 1, but you can adjust it to a different value if needed.
    Service IDs with a sum of stop times greater than the threshold will be included in the returned
    bus. Defaults to 1
    
    Returns:
      A tuple containing the busiest date and a GTFS feed object. The GTFS feed object contains
    information about routes, stops, stop times, trips, and shapes for a transit agency's schedule.
