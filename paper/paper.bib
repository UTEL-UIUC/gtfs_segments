  abstract = {Discussions of bus stop consolidation sometimes refer to average stop spacings, but there are no reliable statistics about spacings, nor methodologies for calculating them. This paper aims to clarify discussions of bus stop spacings by introducing clear definitions, a methodology for creating statistics from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files, and a python package, gtfs-segments, which splits bus networks into isolated `segments.' With the package, we calculate national-level statistics from 539 US transit providers and 83 Canadian providers, as well as agency-level statistics for 30 providers in the US, 10 in Canada, and a sample of 38 providers from other countries. Our estimates of US and Canadian mean spacings are both around 350~m (slightly wider than five stops per mile). US spacings are wider than sometimes claimed but narrower than those in other countries. Finally, the paper gives examples of metrics created by combining GTFS with data from other sources and proposes research ideas and applications to transit planning involving fine-grained stop spacing data.},

  abstract       = {With the emergence of ride-sourcing and ride-splitting services, more options are available to support shifts away from transit, where maintaining transit ridership increases requirements for transit service quality, so as to promote high-capacity and sustainable transport systems. In this endeavor, proper transit stop spacing is critical for both service accessibility and in-vehicle trip efficiency, as well as operation cost. This research explores acceptable stop spacing for three kinds of transit services from the perspective of travel behavior, drawing on the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the United States. A stochastic frontier model is developed to infer passengers&rsquo; unobservable vertex of acceptable transit access times on the basis of observed walk time, which can be converted to the tolerance with respect to stop spacing with the average walking speed. Significant explanatory variables on the vertex of acceptable transit stop spacing are further identified with their quantified impacts, including household density, household income, wait time, trip distance, transfer, and maintenance purpose, while the inefficiency variance is significantly related to traveler age, wait time, secondary walk time, and trip frequency. Recommended response strategies follow. Findings from this study provide insights, guidelines, and implementation plans for different transit agencies when considering stop spacing redesign, to strengthen transit service appeal and to promote cooperative and sustainable multi-modal urban transport systems.},
